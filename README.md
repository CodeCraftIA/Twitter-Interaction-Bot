# Twitter-Interaction-Bot
This script initializes a Twikit client to interact with specific Twitter handles by liking, retweeting, and replying to their tweets. It saves login cookies for future sessions, maintains a record of interacted tweets to avoid duplicate interactions, and can handle multiple user handles.
